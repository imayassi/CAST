# Capacity Analytics & Simulation Toolkit (CAST)

**CAST** is a Python framework for analyzing team capacity, workload stress, and optimal headcount distribution.  
It helps operations and business leaders understand how teams are performing, identify imbalances, and simulate "what-if" staffing scenarios ‚Äî all powered by interpretable analytics and machine learning.

## üöÄ What CAST Does

- **Capacity Score (0‚Äì100)** ‚Äì Quantifies each employee‚Äôs operational output relative to their peers using a machine-learning model.  
- **Workload Stress Index (WSI, 0‚Äì100)** ‚Äì Measures workload pressure by blending capacity deviation, persistence, complexity, and time pressure.  
- **Driver Analysis** ‚Äì Explains what factors drive high or low Capacity Scores at both individual and organizational levels.  
- **Scenario Simulation** ‚Äì Models the impact of moving engineers between teams on key metrics like WSI, efficiency, and backlog.  
- **Optimization Engine** ‚Äì Recommends optimal headcount distribution to maximize efficiency and volume while minimizing stress and backlog.  
- **Automated Executive Summary** ‚Äì Generates an HTML report with charts and LLM-powered narratives for non-technical audiences.

## üß© Core Concepts

### 1. Capacity Score
A 0‚Äì100 measure of **operational capacity and performance** relative to team benchmarks.  
Built using a transparent machine-learning model (**DSLI ‚Äì Directional Sparse Logistic Index**) that evaluates:

| Dimension | Example Features |
|------------|------------------|
| Workload   | `numCases`, `backlog`, `TimeSpent` |
| Efficiency | `avgDaysToClose`, `som`, `activeTimeRatio` |
| Experience | `tenure`, `AICS`, `LinearityScore` |

Higher Capacity = greater ability to handle volume efficiently.

### 2. Workload Stress Index (WSI)
A 0‚Äì100 composite index that quantifies **pressure and sustainability** of workload.  
It combines four interpretable factors:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Capacity Deviation (45%)** | How current load compares to an engineer‚Äôs typical baseline. |
| **Persistence (25%)** | Duration of sustained high workload. |
| **Complexity (15%)** | Case difficulty and severity mix. |
| **Time Pressure (15%)** | Weekend/after-hours or 24√ó7 commitments. |

Higher WSI = higher stress risk; teams target **high Capacity + moderate WSI**.
